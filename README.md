# wsl_care

Keeps the WSL VM on this machine from degrading over the working day: a systemd timer inside `Ubuntu`
that records memory, disk and Docker state every 4 hours and applies safe cleanups, plus a VS Code
extension that shows the state and runs cleanups on demand.

| Folder | Holds |
|---|---|
| `src_daemon/` | the C# Native AOT daemon/CLI `wsl-care` — today a skeleton that answers `--help` and `--version` |
| [todo/](todo/README.md) | open plans |
| [research/](research/) | measurements of the system as it is — start with [the 2026-10-02 baseline](research/2026-10-02_wsl_resource_baseline.md) and [the architecture](research/architecture.md) |
| `research/diagnostics/` | the read-only scripts that produced the baseline |

## Build and test

Needs the .NET 10 SDK (`global.json` pins `10.0.100` with `rollForward: latestFeature`). Every
MSBuild command carries `-m:4`; the root `Directory.Build.rsp` adds `-nr:false`.

```bash
dotnet build wsl_care.slnx -c Release -m:4

# Tests are xUnit v3 executables — run them directly, NEVER `dotnet test` (no VSTest host here)
./src_daemon/tests/WslCare.Core.Tests/bin/Release/net10.0/WslCare.Core.Tests.exe
./src_daemon/tests/WslCare.Cli.Tests/bin/Release/net10.0/WslCare.Cli.Tests.exe
./src_daemon/tests/WslCare.Cli.Tests/bin/Release/net10.0/WslCare.Cli.Tests.exe --filter-method "*Version*"

# Formatting, as CI checks it (reports, never rewrites)
dotnet format wsl_care.slnx --verify-no-changes

# Native AOT binary (on Windows the MSVC build tools are needed, with vswhere.exe on PATH)
dotnet publish src_daemon/src/WslCare.Cli/WslCare.Cli.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 -o artifacts/publish/win-x64 -m:4
./artifacts/publish/win-x64/wsl-care.exe --help
```

On Linux drop the `.exe` and publish with `-r linux-x64` (needs `clang` and `zlib1g-dev`). The daemon's
version is `src_daemon/version.txt`. What each test covers is in
[research/module_tests.md](research/module_tests.md).
